## üîë Key Features
- **Notebook-style interface with chat capabilities in a web UI**: Work on your data pipelines in a familiar Jupyter notebook interface, while the AI copilot assists and guides you by generating, executing, and debugging data engineering code throughout the process. 
- **No vendor lock-in**: Build your data pipelines with any data stack of your choice, and select the LLM you prefer for your copilot, with full flexibility.
- **Fully customizable**: Break down your pipeline into multiple components‚Äîsuch as data movement, transformation, and more‚Äîand tailor each component to your specific needs. Splicing then seamlessly assembles these components into a complete, functional data pipeline.
- **Secure and manageable**: Host Splicing on your own infrastructure, with full control over your data and LLMs. Your data and secret keys are never shared with LLM providers at any time.

## ‚ö° Quick Start
The easiest way to run Splicing is in Docker:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). 

2. Run the following command to run Splicing:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/.splicing:/.splicing \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -it --rm splicingai/splicing:latest
```
By default, all application data is stored in the `./.splicing` folder within the current directory where you run the above command. If you want to persist the data, make sure to back up this folder.

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access the web UI.

You can also install Splicing without Docker for development by following the instructions in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#set-up-the-development-environment) guide.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- **Data pipeline deployment**: Support deploying data pipelines to your production environments with a push-to-deploy experience.
- **More data pipeline components**: Support for more essential components in data pipelines, such as data quality checks and data lineage.
- **More integrations**: 
  + Support for a wide range of data integrations in data pipelines (e.g., various data sources and warehouses). 
  + Support more LLMs as copilots (e.g., Claude and local models). 
  + Streamline source code structure, making it easier for the community to add integrations.
- **Smarter copilot**: Enhance the copilot with more capabilities, such as automatically generating semantic models and ER diagrams for data in warehouses, making it easier to build data pipelines.
