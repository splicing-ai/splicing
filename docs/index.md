# Introduction

Splicing is an open-source AI copilot for effortless data pipeline building. It offers the following key features:

- **Notebook-style interface with chat capabilities in a web UI**: Work on your data pipelines in a familiar Jupyter notebook interface, while the AI copilot assists and guides you by generating, executing, and debugging data engineering code throughout the process. 
- **No vendor lock-in**: Build your data pipelines with any data stack of your choice, and select the LLM you prefer for your copilot, with full flexibility.
- **Fully customizable**: Break down your pipeline into multiple components—such as data movement, transformation, and more—and tailor each component to your specific needs. Splicing then seamlessly assembles these components into a complete, functional data pipeline.
- **Secure and manageable**: Host Splicing on your own infrastructure, with full control over your data and LLMs. Your data and secret keys are never shared with LLM providers at any time.

### Connect Pipeline Components and Recommend Data Engineering Techniques
When building a data pipeline, each component operates on the context and data from the previous one. Splicing Copilot understands this flow and recommends optimal data engineering techniques based on your pipeline's context.
